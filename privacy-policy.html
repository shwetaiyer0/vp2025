      <h2>THIRD-PARTY COOKIES</h2>
      <ol type="1">
        <li><span class="bold">Google Analytics</span> - We use a minimal build of Google Analytics, a service which transmits website traffic data to Google servers in the United States and allows us to notice trends to improve the user experience on our website. This minimal build processes personal data such as: the unique User ID set by Google Analytics, the date and time, the title of the page being viewed, the URL of the page being viewed, the URL of the page that was viewed prior to the current page, the screen resolution, the time in local time zone, the files that were clicked on and downloaded, the links clicked on to an outside domain, the type of device, and the country, region, and city. This information allows us to understand individual behaviours and needs more accurately. For more information on how Google uses the data collected via this service, see here: <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites" target="_blank">Google privacy</a><br><span class="bold">To opt out of being tracked via Google Analytics</span>, You can also use Google's opt-out browser add-on: <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank">Opt-out</a></li>
        <li><span class="bold">Facebook</span> - This website uses the so-called "Facebook Pixel" of the social network "Facebook" for the following purposes:</li>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="bold">Facebook (website) Custom Audiences</span> - We use the Facebook pixel for remarketing purposes to be able to contact You again within 180 days. This allows us to display interest-based advertisements ("Facebook Ads") to users of the website when they visit the social network "Facebook" or other websites also using this tool. In this way, we pursue the interest in displaying advertisements that are of interest to You in order to make our website or offers more interesting for You. </li>
          <li><span class="bold">Facebook conversion</span> - We also use the Facebook Pixel to ensure that our Facebook Ads match the potential interest of users and are not annoying. With the help of the Facebook Pixel, we can track the effectiveness of Facebook ads for statistical and market research purposes by seeing whether users were redirected to our website after clicking on a Facebook ad (so-called "conversion").</li>
        </ul>
      </ol>
      <p>Due to the marketing tools used, your browser automatically establishes a direct connection with the Facebook server as soon as You have agreed to the use of cookies requiring your consent. Through the integration of the Facebook pixel, Facebook receives the information that You have called up the corresponding website of our internet presence or clicked on an advertisement from us. If You are registered with a Facebook service, Facebook can assign the visit to your account. The processing of this data by Facebook takes place within the framework of Facebook's <a href="https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy/?entry_point=data_policy_redirect&entry=0" target="_blank">data policy</a>. Special information and details about the Facebook pixel and its functionality can also be found in the Facebook help area.</p>
